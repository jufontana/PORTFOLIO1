						<b>MILD HIGH CLUB |</b><i> Skiptracing.</i>
						<p>Mild High Club is the solo act of Alex Brettin, a tourmate and disciple of Mac DeMarco's sunny sound. On his sophomore album, Brettin finds a voice more distinctly his own.</p>
						<p>The album frontloads Brettin's best results: the first three tracks function as a heavenly, psychedelic triptych. The eponymous opener has a slinky beat and bass line that sets the chill tone nicely. It's embellished by periodic cowbell percussion that feels cheesy and lovely at once, and a beautiful slide guitar solo that George Harrison would appreciate. "Skiptracing" slides directly into "Homage," which begins with some plinky DeMarco-style guitar and a baroque harpsichord before a lush, sunburst chorus emerges. "Homage" tumbles into "Cary Me Back", which uses a circulating melody and cymbal hits to summon a bit of the "'Til I Die" ache from the Beach Boys' own early '70s L.A. masterpiece, "Surf's Up" (Pitchfork).</p>

						<b>BADBADNOTGOOD |</b><i> IV.</i>
						<p>On their fourth record, the succinctly titled *IV, *BADBADNOTGOOD rein in their jam-band impulses, delivering a velvet-crushed portrait of an effervescent lounge act in the 21st century.</p>
						<p>Five years ago, Canada's BADBADNOTGOOD, then a trio, uploaded a shaky black-and-white clip of them playing jazz interpolations of Odd Future songs onto YouTube. (Most prominent among them was raucous rendition of "Orange Juice.") They played the suite for their professors at music school to a chilly reception. Bad grade and all, things turned out well, and they caught the eye of Tyler, the Creator, who became their first supporter, sharing their "Odd Future Sessions" on social media. Just a year later, they uploaded yet another video - Tyler, the Creator running through "Orange Juice" with BBNG as a backing band. The band's technical prowess and smooth sound cushioned Tyler's snarl. Their drummer, Alex Sowinski, is clad in a creepy pig mask, and Tyler stalks around the room with a Colt 45 in hand. Filled with whimsical vulgarity and instrumental pyrotechnics, it was visual candy for college-aged boys" (Pitchfork).</p>
